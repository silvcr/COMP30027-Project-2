# COMP30027-Project-2

README File for Project 2 - Ordinal Classification of Cooking Time of Recipes.

Required libraries:
- pandas
- scipy
- numpy
- sklearn
- mord
- matplotlib

The Kaggle file for Ordinal K-NN is labeled 'knn_labels.csv'
The Kaggle file for Ordinal Logistic Regression is labeled 'reg_labels.csv'

Both of these files can be generated again by running 'Assignment 2 - submission version.ipynb'. All analysis 
used in the report can also be generated from this file.

However, the output files from the code generates labels with no decimal points - so an additional step of fixing 
decimal points in Microsoft Excel (or any relevant software) is required.
